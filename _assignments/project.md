## Discovery

### High Vision Canvas

Use the template provided and the example to create your group canvas.

Take your main idea, and build out the structure that defines the idea.
- Fill in the *Genre*, describing what type of app/game you will be creating. Examples for
games might be Adventure (Moss), 3rd Person Action (Astro Bot), 1st Person Action, etc.
Apps could include Area Tour, Travel, Productivity.
- Determine *IP/World*: IP (Intellectual Property) is for licensed games so this should not apply. World would describe setting, Sci-Fi, Post-Apocalyptic, etc. Apps would address location or family of the App (Word Processing, etc.)
- *Inspirations*: Apps/Games that inspire elements or features in your product. Note the Title of what is inspiring your team and what area of your app/game is being inspired. The sources can be movies, games, comics, TV shows, books, apps, etc.

Determine your Target Audience (User Experience & User Types):
- The *User Experience* describes what emotions you want to evoke in the player/user. Examples include wonder, immersion, excitement, fear, pride, etc. Normally would be in the form of "The user feels...."
- The *User Types* are the groups that you want to create the experience for. This should be more specific that "casual" or "hardcore" and should describe the main focus of the user.
  - Examples of gamer classifications are: "Grinder", "Completionist", "Explorer", "Collector", etc.
  - Make up your own in this situation and rank them based on what you think is the biggest group down to the smaller. Four or five is a good count.

Add the *Core Pillars*, these are the key "features" that support the User Experience Elements. These pillars are the elements that describe the essence of the app/game, the app/game would not be the same without them.
- Game Example: Skyrim might have a Player Experience point that says "The Player feels driven to advance and customize their character. The core pillar that supports this might be "Player can gain experience by completing adventures and obtaining new levels that offer new skills".

*Gameplay systems* describes the key low-level systems that must be created.
- As above for Skyrim: The Experience system (includes the Skill system &
character attribute system). The exploration system would also apply here.

*Team Milestone Plan*: Create a simple team milestone for the 3-week pre-pro phase. This should be using the milestone template provided.

*Feature List*: Use the Canvas and the Action Loop to determine the main features of your app/game. This should use the Feature List template.

*High Level Action Loop*: Prepare an action loop that shows the main flow of your app/game.
