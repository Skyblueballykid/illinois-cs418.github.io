## Overview ##

Interactive Computer Graphics is about the techniques and technologies used to generate synthetic digital imagery in real-time. The main focus of the course will be 3D photorealistic rendering and the current, practical rendering methods used in games and other applications.

The topics we will cover include:
+ Geoemetric modeling
+ Mathematics for animation and rendering
+ Shading and programmable shaders
+ Rasterization
+ Physics simulation
+ Global illumination

We will learn how to implement 3D web applications using WebGL and JavaScript. WebGL shares many of the same characteristics as Vulkan, Direct3D, and other popular low-level graphics APIs, so the skills you learn should be transferable.

## Office Hours ##

**Every Thursday at 11am on [ZOOM](https://illinois.zoom.us/j/475317507)**

## Prerequisites ##
We recommend the following courses and skills:

- [CS 225](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs225/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} - prior general programming experience
- [Math 225](https://math.illinois.edu/resources/department-resources/syllabus-math-225){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} or [Math 415](https://math.illinois.edu/resources/department-resources/syllabus-math-415){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} - basic linear algebra, especially 3D transforms

## Lectures ##
Lecture is held in 1310 DCL on Tu Th 11-12:15

## Discussion Sections ##
We will not use discussion sections this semester...you only need to attend lecture.

## Programming Assignments ##
There will a series of four programming assignments. See the [Assignments page](/assignments) for more details.

## In-Class Work (or Homework) ##

Starting in Week 2 of the semester, each (or almost each) lecture will include in-class exercises. These exercises will be available online using the PrairieLearn system. You should bring a phone or laptop or tablet to lecture. If you are unable to bring a device, let the course staff know and we will make other arrangements.

In total the in-class work will be worth 5% of your total course grade. Each of the N assignments will be P=5/N points. Grading for the exercises will be as follows:

+ Exercise completed correctly in-class will be worth P points plus P points of Extra Credit   
+ Exercise completed correctly outside of class within 1 week will be worth P points.
+ Exercise completed correctly after 1 week but before the end of the semester will be worth P/2 points.

These exercises can be done in groups and you can submit answers an unlimited number of times. 

**Attending class and completing the work is a chance to earn 5% extra credit for the semester**

### 4 Credit Option ###
If you are taking the course for 4 credits, you will complete an extra project implelementing a ray-tracer.

## Exams ##
This class will have three midterm exams and no final exam. The third midterm will be just before finals. Each exam is 50 minutes long.

- Midterm 1: Feb. 17 - Feb. 19
- Midterm 2: April 7 (online, details to be announced on piazza)
- Midterm 3: May 5 (online, details to be announced on piazza)

All exams are closed-everything (no book, notes, calculator, etc.). See the [CBTF policies](https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu/for-students/policies.html) for more detail.You are responsible for all material covered in lectures and assignments.For DRES accommodations see [CBTF DRES Students](https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu/for-students/dres-students.html)

## Grades ##
We will post grades on [Compass 2g](https://compass.illinois.edu){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

We weight grades as follows:

| | 3 credits | 4 credits |  
| ----- | ------ | ----- |  
| MP 1 | 10% | 10% | 
| MP 2 | 15% | 10% | 
| MP 3 | 15% | 10% | 
| MP 4 | 10% | 10% | 
| In-class Work   | 5%  | 5%  |
| Exam Grade| 45% | 45% |   
| 4 Credit Project | | 10% |  

You can expect the cutoffs to be approximately as follows
98 - 100: A+  
93 - 98: A
90 - 93: A-
87 - 90: B+
83 - 87: B
80 - 83: B-
77 - 80: C+
73 - 77: C
70 - 73: C-
60 - 70: D
Below 60: F

## Textbooks ##

There is no book for the class. Notes and other materials will be posted online.
We do have some suggested books if you need help figuring things out:

![Fundamentals of Computer Graphics 4th Edition by Steve Marschner, Peter Shirley](/img/shirley.jpg){:height="200px" width="160px"}

_Fundamentals of Computer Graphics 4th Edition_ by Steve Marschner, Peter Shirley  
Deals with the theoretical and mathematical aspects of computer graphics. Very readable.

![WebGL Programming Guide: Interactive 3D Graphics Programming with WebGL by Kouichi Matsuda and Rodger Lea](/img/wengl1.jpg){:height="200px" width="200px"}

_WebGL Programming Guide: Interactive 3D Graphics Programming with WebGL_  
by Kouichi Matsuda and Rodger Lea  
A bit old now, but pretty easy to read with decent example code.
